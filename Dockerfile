# ENZO — self-hosted docker image
#
# Two variants of the same image, chosen at build time:
#   --build-arg THEME_VARIANT=lite  (default) → one theme video: the 3.3MB
#       AI-animated NYC subway ride loop (see marketplace/CREDITS.md) — the
#       one Marketplace workspace theme the lite registry carries beyond the
#       WebGL default. Homepage = Nebula drift (pure WebGL). Image stays
#       ~150MB compressed.
#   --build-arg THEME_VARIANT=full  → all 23 theme videos (~470MB compressed),
#       every homepage + workspace theme, exactly like the hosted deployment.
#
# Google identity login is removed in this variant in ALL builds
# (ENZO_GOOGLE_AUTH=0 / VITE_GOOGLE_AUTH=0): login is provider-key onboarding
# (OpenRouter / NVIDIA / Google AI Studio / HuggingFace / Cloudflare — BYOK).
#
# node:22-slim, not alpine: better-sqlite3 ships glibc prebuilds and would
# otherwise compile from source against musl on every build.
#
# The container runs as the unprivileged `node` user. Every path the backend
# writes at runtime lives under /app (model caches in src/models/, agent
# memory in src/core/memory-store.json, generated projects, learned skills),
# and /app is node-owned from the first layer — no root anywhere.

# deleted BEFORE the build so vite's copy of public/ → dist/ stays small too.
